This repository serves as the central hub for storing and managing my community health files. These files provide
important information about guidelines, best practices, and expectations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a centralized location for all community health-related files.

## File Structure

The repository contains the following folders and files:

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/afuetterer/.github/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): Our code of conduct,
  outlining expected behavior and standards.
- [Issue Templates](https://github.com/afuetterer/.github/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE): Templates for creating bug
  reports and feature requests. These templates help us better understand your request and ensure that we're addressing
  the right information.
- [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/afuetterer/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): A template
  to use when creating a pull request.

## How to Use

By default, these community health files are applied to all repositories of the GitHub user unless overridden by a
specific repository.

## Overriding a Central File in a Single Repository

Sometimes, you may need to override a central file for your specific repository. To do so:

1. Create a new file in the root of your repository with the same name as the central file (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
1. In this new file, include any changes or additions specific to your repository.
1. Add a note at the top of the file indicating that it overrides the central file (e.g., # This file overrides the
   central contributing guidelines found in `afuetterer/.github`).
